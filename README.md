## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This is my first time creating a personal project and I will be using GitHub for that. It is a static website based on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, explaining the importance of nutritious meals for the human body. The project is useful in terms of visually displaying the relationship between the design/colours/functionality of a website and user experience, highlighting how a user-friendly website can engage people and help them understand the provided information better. It is a basic website which is focused on front-end development.
